##Game Description
In this game, you play as a *cube defender* that is on the bottom of the screen. The cubes are changing color as they fall down and they are also accelerating as time goes on.
You can decelerate them by shooting them down. The goal is to shoot down as many cubes as possible,
before one of them reaches the bottom screen(**defender platform**). For comparison the current result is being captured on the window title.

## Game Instructions
* Move left: Hold down key **A**
* Move right: Hold down key **D**
* Shoot: Press key **W**

## Rubric Points Adressed
### README 
* All Rubric Points
### Compiling and Testing
* All Rubric Points
### Loops, Functions, I/O
* The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.
* The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.
### Object Oriented Programming
* The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.
* Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.
* Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.
* Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.
* Classes encapsulate behavior.
* Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.
* Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.
### Memory Management
* The project makes use of references in function declarations.
* The project uses destructors appropriately.
